			<h4>ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS</h4>
			<p>Our client is Rasmus Stene, the vice-president of Trondheim Go Club.</p>
			<h4>SITE PURPOSE/GOAL</h4>
			<p>The purpose or goal of the site is to inform potential members of the existence of the club. The website will fully target the audience outside of
			the club, as an internal communication system is already in place for existing members.
			The potential members should have easy access to all essential information regarding the club. This information includes information such as contact and
			schedule information.

			The club also wishes to encourage people who do not play Go to reserach, get a basic understanding, and interest in the game.
			</p>
			<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCE</h4>
			<p>Go is a board game for people in all age groups, however the club does not wish to target the youngest audience.
			So the club wish to target an audience in the ages between 17 up to no limit. This also include both genders.
			Being a NTNU student is no requirement to join the club. As the club is already recruiting NTNU students, it's positive to enforce the welcome to
			non-student visitors of the website.
			</p>

			<h4>CONTENT</h4>
				<h5>Intro page</h5>
				  <h4>IKKE LEVER FØR DETTE ER ENDRET:</h4><i>Jeg er litt usikker på hva vi snakket om her.
				   i møtereferatet står det: "- intro-side/pop-up(med logo)"
					</i>
				<h5>Front page</h5>
					<p>
						The most important section is the homepage. The homepage will need to advise the visitor of all the high
						priority information which the club wishes to inform its potential members. The subpages will be accessable
						from the homepage, and expand the information given on the homepage. The possibility to register your email
						address on a subscription list for club information will also be available here.
					</p>
				<h5>Contact information</h5>
					<p>
						A page that contains  contact information for the club and members with various responsibilities.
					</p>

				<h5>Scheduling information</h5>
					<p>
						A page that contains information on dates and times for when matches are played, and other club meetings
						when necessary.
					</p>

				<h5>About Go</h5>
					<p>
						A page that contains information on the game Go. The exact content is not yet decided on, but it will be
						things like the rules of Go and its history. On this page there will also be links to external resources
						(e.g. tutorials) for future and current Go-players.
					</p>

				<h5>About the club</h5>
					<p>
						This page will contain general information about Trondheim Go-club. This could include its history.
					</p>

				<h5>Tournament page</h5>
					<p>
						This page will contain tournament information like match results, current standings and results from
						former torunaments that are finished.
					</p>
					<p>
						On this page a visitor will also be able to register for tournaments. In IT2805 we are not allowed to
						use a database driven website, but forms on the webpage where the submitted data is sent as emails to
						the client are allowed. So a registration system can be designed without the use of a database.
					</p>
				<h5>FAQ</h5>
					<p>
						Will contain answers to frequently asked questions.
					</p>


			<h4>AFTER PROJECT DETAILS</h4>
			<p>The current website of Trondheim Go Club is published under PVV's (Programvareverkstedet) domain, and has been for many years. The club's current page is found at: http://www.pvv.org/~vlarsen/trhm-go/
			The club currently have no plans moving to another domain after the release of the new website.
			After the release the club is going to pass the workload of maintaining the website around within the club, as most of the club members have a degree in computer science
			or currently in the process of earning one.</p>
