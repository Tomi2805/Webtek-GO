			<h4>ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS</h4>
			<p>Our client is Rasmus Stene, the vice-president of Trondheim Go Club.</p>
			<h4>SITE PURPOSE/GOAL</h4>
			<p>The purpose or goal of the site is to inform potential members of the existence of the club. The website will fully target the audience outside of
			the club, as an internal communication system is already in place for existing members.
			The potential members should have easy access to all essential information regarding the club. This information includes information such as contact and
			schedule information.

			The club also wishes to encourage people who do not play Go to reserach, get a basic understanding, and interest in the game.
			</p>
			<h4>INTENDED AUDIENCE</h4>
			<p>Go is a board game for people in all age groups, however the club does not wish to target the youngest audience.
			So the club wish to target an audience in the ages between 17 up to no limit. This also include both genders.
			Being a NTNU student is no requirement to join the club. As the club is already recruiting NTNU students, it's positive to enforce the welcome to
			non-student visitors of the website.

			</p>
			<h4>CONTENT</h4>
			<p> The most important section is the homepage. The homepage will need to advise the visitor of all the high priority information which the club wishes to inform
			its potential members. The subpages will be accessable from the homepage, and expand the information given on the homepage. The subpages will include sections
			such as FAQ, contact, learn go, and many others.
			</p>
			<h4>AFTER PROJECT DETAILS</h4>
			<p>The current website of Trondheim Go Club is published under the PVV (Programvareverkstedet) domain, and has been for many years. The club's current page is found at: http://www.pvv.org/~vlarsen/trhm-go/
			The club currently have no plans moving to another domain after the release of the new website.
			After the release the club is going to pass the workload of maintaining the website around within the club, as most of the club members have a degree in computer science
			or currently in the process of earning one.</p>
